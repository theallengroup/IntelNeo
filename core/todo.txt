		b2p = THIS URL; URL_ENCODED: 
			?mod=this&ac=all_edit

	on

	see
		$_GET['suggest']
		turn it into a label
		make b2l have a special behavior
		more like b2parent, instead of b2l
		when you get 	
			$_get[B2P]

		
		SAVE IT IN 
			$_session['PREVIOUS'][CURRENT_URL] = PREVIOUS_URL, UNENCODED

		the form buttons:
			b2l
			save
		

		user enters data. ..... 


	
		THEN, he hits 
			b2l: 
				read 
					session[refferer]
				see if there is anything in there!
				if you find anything, re-direct him to the url stored there
				trash the url stored there
			save
				save the data, and run ac_b2l

		this should effectively return the user to thre previous-previous url
		remember to save the whole URL, not just parts of it like mod and ac, since the shole url may be
		neede to reconstruct the previous behavior, given special params that you might not be entering!


	this sounds like major surgery, but it isnt, and it allows us to help the user manage better his workflow
	
------------



on foreign field, 
	modify the label, and let the iser, IF ALLOWED!!! this->privilege_manager->is_allowed() , to go to the parent id

	field   _____
	field 2 _______			
	<a mod=parent&ac=all_edit&id=CURRENT_ID onclick=location.href='?parent&ac=all_edit&id=CURRENT_ID' + document.getValue(id) >LABEL</a>
	this will allow users to enter the parent with and without javascript
	having the javascript ENHANCE the experience, but not be the only way IN
	having NO javascript, the system would be somewhat harder to use, but still helpful, mostly for STATIC data
	(this applies to MOST of the data)
